# DSA-in-C

A collection of simple Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in C.

---

## üìÅ File Descriptions

### `binarySearch.c`
Implements binary search on a sorted array using divide-and-conquer.

---

### `BinaryTree.c`
Binary Tree implementation with support for:
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal

---

### `CircularLinkedList.c`
Circular linked list where the tail points back to the head.  
Useful for cyclic data structures.

---

### `DoubleLinkedList.c`
Doubly linked list with both `next` and `prev` pointers.  
Maintains separate head and tail for bidirectional traversal.

---

### `HashMap.c`
Simple Hash Map implementation:
- Basic hash function
- Insertion and deletion
- No duplicate keys (updates value if key exists)

---

### `LinkedList.c`
Basic singly linked list.  
Simplest dynamic data structure in this collection.

---

### `queue.c`
Queue using a linked list (FIFO structure):
- Enqueue (add)
- Dequeue (remove)

---

### `stack.c`
Stack using a linked list (LIFO structure):
- Push (add)
- Pop (remove)

---

### `trees.c`
General Tree where a parent can have multiple children.  
Node values are stored as strings.

---

### `mergesort.c`
Merge Sort algorithm on a preset array of integers.  
Uses recursion and divide-and-conquer.

---

### `graphDFS.c`
Graph traversal using **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.

---

### `graphBFS.c`
Graph traversal using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.

---

## üìå Notes
This project is for learning purposes.  
Each file demonstrates the core logic of basic data structures and algorithms in a minimal, easy-to-understand way.
